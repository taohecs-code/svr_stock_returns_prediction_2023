### Abstract
One of the key subjects for academic scholars and professional investors is the forecasting of
stock returns and prices. As advancements in computing technologies have progressed, the machine
learning approach has garnered significant attention. This study compares and evaluates two forecasting
models, the SVR model, and the ARIMA model. The analysis is conducted using data from the NYSE
Composite Index, the S&P 500 Index, the Dow Jones Industrial Average Index, and the Nasdaq Composite
Index, spanning from January 1, 2012, to September 1, 2023, as the experimental time series. Initially,
before applying the ARIMA model, the stationarity of the time series data is verified through ACF and
PACF analyses. Grid search and cross-validation methods are then used to pinpoint three main feature
factors. The output of both models is then evaluated using metrics like MAE, MSE, and RMSE before
prediction values are produced. The SVR model performs better than other models, which suggests that it
could be a good option for future stock return forecasting projects based on empirical evidence.
